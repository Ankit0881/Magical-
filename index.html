    <p>🐣 Hii Mona,</p>
    <p>I know this might be a little awkward, but I want to confess...</p>
    <p>From our first talks, slowly, feelings started to grow inside me. I feel every moment we share—your way of talking freely, those funny conversations, your silly antics, every little thing, your anger, your energy...</p>
    <p>It's like people say, "It's the most wonderful feeling in the world," and I feel the same. I can't describe you because everything about you is just perfect 😊. Most of the time, I think about you. When we talk, I feel complete, and when you're not there, it just feels... average, and I start waiting for you again.</p>
    <p>And I know it's not just attraction. Attraction doesn't bring such pure and hard feelings for someone. But with you, it's different 🤌💖.</p>
    <p>It may sound like a line from a movie, but I just had to share this 🌷. So, I want to say one thing: I don't like you, I love you 💖.</p>
    <p>Because there's a huge difference between 'like' and 'love'. What you like, you care for a while and then let go. But what you love, you never let go of. You take care of it, nurture it, and never let it fade away.</p>
    <p>Just like that, I want to say I love you 😊🤌🫀, and I’m waiting for your reply 🐣. My heart feels incomplete without you 🍁 Love you 💖.</p>
